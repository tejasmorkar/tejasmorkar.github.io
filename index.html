                                the web itself. You can try to change number of
                                neurons, learning rate, and epochs. It is an
                                exploratory tutorial into the California Housing

                                obviously other than the Cuda errors, must be
                                deploying the model elsewhere to present your

                                This is a project which takes an input of the
                                sudoku puzzles as an 81 characters long string
                                containing the digits from 0 to 9, where 0
                                represents an unfilled cell of the Sudoku Board.
                                The objective of the algorithm is to replace all
                                the zeros with valid digits such that the entire
                                Sudoku Puzzle is solved. For doing this in a
                                conventional way, the processor will require to
                                try all 2*1077 possible combinations in a worst
                                case scenario which is a huge number. So, to
                                solve this problem in a comparatively less time,
                                the Backtracking Algorithm is one of the best
                                solutions to it.

                                Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial
                                number-placement puzzle. The objective is to
                                fill a 9√ó9 grid with digits so that each column,
                                each row, and each of the nine 3√ó3 subgrids that
                                compose the grid contain all of the digits from
                                1 to 9. (Source -

                                Pie & AI is a series of DeepLearning.AI meetups
                                independently hosted by community groups. This
                                event is hosted by PCCoE ACM Student Chapter.
                                Special thanks to their support!

                                Pie & AI: Pune - Intro to GANs will be an event
                                for beginners in the Machine Learning domain who
                                want to know more about this beautiful idea of
                                GANs. It will introduce the attendees to GANs,
                                their various types, and use cases along with a
                                proper understanding of its concept. The
                                attendees will leave the event with better
                                knowledge about it and a clear path of what can
                                and cannot be done using GANs and will have a
                                clear idea of where to start studying it.

                                follows. But is that it? Is it just the task
                                that we humans assign the machines to do or is
                                it something more than that?

                                Machine Learning is in a stage of booming and

                                going on. Everyone wants to understand it and
                                break into AI for utilizing its power.
                                Unfortunately, it is often perceived as a
                                miraculous black box that takes some input data
                                and gives out magical predictions but it has got
                                so much more to it than that. Students and
                                developers from various traits and fields want
                                to start using Machine Learning in their
